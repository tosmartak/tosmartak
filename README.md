### 👋 Hi, I’m Tosin Harold Akingbemisilu

- 👀 I am a data scientist, with a keen interest in ML/AI/NN.
- 💞️ I totally love and enjoy the idea of making sense of data from different sources and looking to collaborate on any machine learning / neural networks projects

#### 🌱 Outside of work, I enjoy:
- 😅 hanging out with friends and making new connections
- 🤸 doing calisthenics - bodyweight training just helps a lot without having to visit the gym too often
- 📚 reading lot of books
- ♟️ Playing chess, and currently my new found love of playing the piano 🎹.
