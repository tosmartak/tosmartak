- 👋 Hi, I’m Tosin Harold Akingbemisilu @tosmartak
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science and Engineering.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Science and engineering by doing projects... I just love the idea of getting usable insights from lots of data, and creating an environment to get those data. I guess that would be my own contribution towards making the world a better place with data.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Data Science Projects and looking forward to learning a lot from the community
- 📫 You can reach me here or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tosin-akingbemisilu)
